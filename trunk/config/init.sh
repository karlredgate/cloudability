# Replace this with a list of initialization commands for a
# newly started server using "HOST" instead of the hostname
# and "KEY" instead of the path to your ".pem" SSH key file.

# For example:
#
# scp -i KEY ~/perl/env.pl root@HOST:cloudability/perl/
# ssh -i KEY root@HOST bin/cloudserver -restart
